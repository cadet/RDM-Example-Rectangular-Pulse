# Project repo
This repo contains the code for an example simulation of the elution of a rectangular pulse using CADET-Process and CADET-RDM. A linear binding model is used and the influence of dispersion on the elution behavior is examined. This example is a reproduction of part of the case study from "Analytical solutions and moment analysis of general rate model for linear liquid chromatography". (Shamsul Qamar, Javeria Nawaz Abbasi, Shumaila Javeed, Andreas Seidel-Morgenstern, Chemical Engineering Science 2014;107:192-205. doi:10.1016/j.ces.2013.12.019.).

also used in the study "Chromatography Analysis and Design Toolkit (CADET)" (Samuel Leweke, Eric von Lieres, Computers & Chemical Engineering 2018;113:274-294. doi:10.1016/j.compchemeng.2018.02.025.)  [**url**: here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compchemeng.2018.02.025) <br>
